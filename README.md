## 5 Devops Concepts

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- IaC allows you to manage and provision infrastructure using code instead of manual setup.
- This improves consistency, scalability, and makes infrastructure repeatable across environments.

### Containerization
- Containerization packages applications with their dependencies into isolated containers.
- It ensures the app runs the same everywhere, reducing environment-related issues.

### Automation
- Automation removes repetitive manual tasks like deployments, testing, and monitoring.
- It speeds up delivery, reduces human errors, and improves overall operational efficiency.

### DevSecOps
- DevSecOps integrates security practices directly into the DevOps process.
- It ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and fixed early instead of after deployment.

### GitOps
- GitOps uses Git as the single source of truth for deployments and infrastructure changes.
- All updates happen through pull requests, enabling better traceability, rollback, and consistency.
